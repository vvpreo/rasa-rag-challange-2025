    "This is a worked example of how to efficiently fine-tune a base language model from [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) using the [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai) and [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/index) libraries for the task of command generation within [CALM](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-pro/calm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsloth integrates with TRL in order to reduce the time and GPU memory required to fine-tune LLMs, when compared to using TRL exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run fine-tuning, you must have first [generated the dataset](https://rasa.com/rasa-pro/docs/operating/fine-tuning-recipe) files `train.jsonl` and `val.jsonl`, which must be in the [TRL instruction format](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer#dataset-format-support)."
